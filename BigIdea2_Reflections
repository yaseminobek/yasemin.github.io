<summary>-2.1 Binary Numbers</summary>
Main idea:
Computers represent all data using the binary system, which only uses 0s and 1s. Each digitâ€™s position represents a power of 2.

Example or concept learned:
For instance, the binary number 0101 equals 5 in decimal because it represents 0*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 5.

Reflection:
I learned that computers can only process data in binary, which means everything from images to songs is stored using combinations of 0s and 1s. 
This matters because it shows how all digital information is simplified into a universal language.

Question:
How do computers convert complex information like colors and sounds into binary so quickly and accurately?
