# Documentation
This is a documentation of problems I have faced and how I overcame them
## Problems I faced:
I faced problems such as my github site not opening and not being able to upload videos.
## How I fixed them:
First, I analyzed what the problem was.
Then, I tried to think of ways I can fix them and asked for help from my teacher and friend. 
After that, I applied the solution such as trying to upload my video from google drive instead of saved folders.
