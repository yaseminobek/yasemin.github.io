<summary>-Documentation</summary>

  This is a documentation of problems I have faced and how I overcame them
## Problems I faced:
Github: I faced problems such as my github site not opening and not being able to upload videos.

Scratch: I faced problems with making the squares show all at the same time. 

Clock: I forgot to put @State in front of minuteSeg, so the hand didn’t update
The hour kept going past 24
## How I fixed them:
Github: First, I analyzed what the problem was.
Then, I tried to think of ways I can fix them and asked for help from my teacher and friend. 
After that, I applied the solution such as trying to upload my video from google drive instead of saved folders.

Scartch: I fixed this problem by adding directions to every square that shpuld have been on the screen and placed them accordingly. 

Clock:I fixed it by adding @State.
I fixed it by using (hour + 1) % 24 to wrap back to 0.

 <summary>-Big Idea 1</summary>
 Big Idea 1: Creative Development is about how computer programs are built and improved through collaboration, design, testing, and error correction.
1.1 Collaboration
 Teamwork and problem-solving are essential in programming. Developers often collaborate with users and other programmers through methods like pair programming, project management tools, or platforms like GitHub. This ensures diverse perspectives and helps avoid bias.
1.2 Program Function and Purpose
 Every program has a function: it takes inputs (like text, images, or sounds), processes them, and produces outputs (like results, visuals, or feedback). The purpose is to solve real-world problems, whether through apps, devices, or systems.
1.3 Program Design and Development
 Designing programs involves planning with algorithms and pseudocode, then turning those into working code. Programmers test, gather data, and refine their solutions. Documentation and comments are also important to explain how and why the program works, making it easier for others to understand and improve.
1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors
 Errors happen in coding—syntax errors, logic errors, or run-time errors. Debugging involves testing, error handling, and using tools like debuggers or extra print statements. This process helps ensure programs run correctly and efficiently.

 So to summarise, Creative Development is about working together, designing with purpose, coding carefully, and fixing mistakes to create programs that solve problems effectively.
