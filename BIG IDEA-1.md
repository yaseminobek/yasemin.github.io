 Big Idea 1: Creative Development is about how computer programs are built and improved through collaboration, design, testing, and error correction.
1.1 Collaboration
 Teamwork and problem-solving are essential in programming. Developers often collaborate with users and other programmers through methods like pair programming, project management tools, or platforms like GitHub. This ensures diverse perspectives and helps avoid bias.
1.2 Program Function and Purpose
 Every program has a function: it takes inputs (like text, images, or sounds), processes them, and produces outputs (like results, visuals, or feedback). The purpose is to solve real-world problems, whether through apps, devices, or systems.
1.3 Program Design and Development
 Designing programs involves planning with algorithms and pseudocode, then turning those into working code. Programmers test, gather data, and refine their solutions. Documentation and comments are also important to explain how and why the program works, making it easier for others to understand and improve.
1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors
 Errors happen in codingâ€”syntax errors, logic errors, or run-time errors. Debugging involves testing, error handling, and using tools like debuggers or extra print statements. This process helps ensure programs run correctly and efficiently.

 So to summarise, Creative Development is about working together, designing with purpose, coding carefully, and fixing mistakes to create programs that solve problems effectively.
